# Example of when IntArrayList would be more efficient and when IntVector would be more efficient.

## IntArrayList
- It is more efficient if the number of elements added grows slowly over time, because it doesn't expand as large.
- For example, in applications where the initial list size is small, like a shopping cart in an online store.

## IntVector
- It is more efficient when the list is expected to grow significantly.
- For example, with large amounts of data that will continually grow, like storing large temporary datasets.
